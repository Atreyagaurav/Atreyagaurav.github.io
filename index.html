<p>
I'm Gaurav Atreya. I am a Civil Engineering graduate from Institute of Engineering (IOE), Pulchowk Campus, Lalitpur, Nepal. 
</p>

<p>
My hobbies are programming and tinkering with my laptop. And exploring the internet. I also watch animes a lot, and have helped fan-translate some light novels. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org67c3f36" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org67c3f36">Programs</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org67c3f36">
<p>
Here are some of the programs I am proud of. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgcdaceb1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcdaceb1">Birthday reminder</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcdaceb1">
<p>
This one program was created to remind myself of the birthdays that I might miss.
This works for any annually celebrated dates, be it xmas or marriage anniversary too. But they have to be celebrated on a fixed date. 
</p>

<p>
I know there are like hundreds of programs which can remind you of the dates, but why is this special? 
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>First it supports Bikram Sambhat (BS) date system. It might not be important for other people but since I'm from Nepal, I needed a program to do that in BS system as well as AD, and that's the reason I made this program.</li>
<li>Second, it's a simple C program, and output is simple, so you can use this in scripts to make other pipelines. For example, I use the output produced by this program to display the birthdays in my desktop.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The program is on my <a href="https://github.com/Atreyagaurav/birthdays-reminder">github repository</a>, so you can fork and modify to your heart's contents. And other details on how to use are also there. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgd8a088f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgd8a088f">Gate Simulator</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd8a088f">
<p>
Another C program. This was me just passing time because I wanted to play around with simulation. But didn't end up as I thought. But as for simulation of electronic gate, I am proud of my file parsing and the calculations for the gates circuit. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org471dcc0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org471dcc0">Calculate Primes</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org471dcc0">
<p>
This is a library I created for python. The core codes are on C, and I can generate a python module with setup.py.
</p>

<p>
The advantage is, this program can generate prime numbers and then cache them in a file, then you can read the file for the prime numbers, which makes it a lot faster than other simple program. The algorithm used to generate the prime number in itself is fast too.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc04bab2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgc04bab2">Landsat Image Downloader</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgc04bab2">
<p>
This is just a fork from someone else, but I have contributed a lot in that original repository because I liked it.
